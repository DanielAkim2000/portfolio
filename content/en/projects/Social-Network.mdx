# Front-End (React Vite)

For this social network project, I developed the user interface with React and Vite.js, which allowed me to explore new front-end development techniques and improve my skills:

- **Advanced state management**: First implementation of Redux and Zustand to manage the application's global state, user sessions, and real-time interactions
- **Interactive social feed**: Creation of a dynamic feed allowing users to see their friends' posts
- **Like system**: Implementation of social interactions allowing users to express interest in posts
- **Multimedia integration**: Support for sharing photos and integrating YouTube videos via links
- **Comment system**: Ability to interact with posts through comments
- **Relationship management**: Interface to manage friend requests, view friend lists, and suggest new connections
- **Responsive design**: Adaptation of the interface for an optimal experience on all devices

The most challenging aspect of front-end development was implementing an efficient state management system with Redux and Zustand to maintain consistency of user data throughout the application.

# Back-End (Express.js)

For the server part of this social network, I used Express.js, which was my first in-depth experience with this framework. This development allowed me to explore:

- **REST architecture**: Design of a complete API to manage users, posts, and interactions
- **Authentication**: Implementation of a secure system with JWT to manage user sessions
- **Image storage**: Implementation of a system to upload and serve profile and post images
- **Data validation**: Control of user inputs to ensure data integrity
- **Query optimization**: Efficient structure of routes and controllers to minimize response times
- **Relationship management**: Modeling connections between users (friends, subscriptions)
- **Real-time notifications**: System to alert users of new interactions (likes, comments, friend requests)

Backend development with Express was particularly enriching, allowing me to understand how to structure a performant and secure API for a social application.

# Main Features

This social network includes a comprehensive set of social features:

## Social Interactions

- **Multimedia posts**: Sharing of text, photos, and YouTube videos
- **Like system**: Ability to like posts and see who has liked them
- **Comments**: Discussion under posts with notifications
- **Content sharing**: Option to repost content from other users

## Network Management

- **Friendship system**: Sending and managing friend requests
- **Connection suggestions**: Algorithm proposing relevant new contacts
- **User search**: Search function to find new friends
- **Customizable profiles**: Profile pages with photos, information, and activity history

## User Experience

- **Personalized feed**: Intelligent display of relevant posts for the user
- **Notifications**: Alerts for new interactions and connections
- **Dark/light mode**: Interface customization option
- **Instant messaging**: Exchange of private messages between users

This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge in full-stack development, particularly in client-side state management with Redux and Zustand, as well as in creating robust APIs with Express. I learned to handle challenges specific to social applications, such as managing relationships between users, media processing, and performance optimization for a smooth user experience.
