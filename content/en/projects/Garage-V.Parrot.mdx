# Front-End (React.js)

For the Garage V. Parrot project, I developed the user interface using React.js. This final study project allowed me to apply my front-end development knowledge and acquire new skills:

- **Responsive interface design**: Creation of a layout adapted to all devices to effectively present garage services and used vehicles
- **React state management**: Use of hooks and state management to handle various user interactions
- **API communication**: Implementation of secure calls to the back-end to retrieve and send data
- **Image display**: Integration of images hosted on Amazon S3 via signed URLs
- **Form system**: Development of forms for contact requests and customer reviews submission
- **Administrator interface**: Creation of a separate dashboard for administrators and employees

This project helped me understand how to structure a complete React application with multiple user access levels and a smooth user experience.

# Back-End (Symfony/PHP)

For the back-end part of Garage V. Parrot, I chose Symfony for its robustness and well-organized structure. This development allowed me to explore several essential aspects:

- **JWT authentication**: Implementation of Lexik JWT Bundle to manage secure user authentication
- **Role management**: Setup of a differentiated permissions system between administrators and employees
- **RESTful API**: Creation of structured endpoints for all site functionalities
- **Image upload and management**: Configuration of Amazon S3 integration to store vehicle images
- **Data validation**: Implementation of server-side validations to ensure data integrity
- **Security**: Protection against common attacks and securing sensitive routes

The most enriching part of this development was setting up the authentication system with JWT tokens and the fine-grained management of authorizations based on user roles.

# Main Features

The Garage V. Parrot site includes several features adapted to the needs of an automotive garage:

## Public Section

- **Services presentation**: Detailed display of services offered by the garage
- **Used vehicles catalog**: Listing with filters and search for available vehicles
- **Customer review system**: Display of testimonials and possibility to submit new ones
- **Contact form**: Appointment scheduling and information requests

## Administration Section

- **Vehicle management**: Addition, modification, and deletion of vehicle listings
- **Services management**: Customization of services displayed on the site
- **Review moderation**: Validation and publication of customer testimonials
- **Employee management**: Administration of accounts with different access levels

This final study project allowed me to develop a complete web application from A to Z, implementing advanced concepts on both the front-end and back-end sides. I particularly enjoyed the challenge of creating a system with different authorization levels and the secure management of external resources such as images on Amazon S3.
