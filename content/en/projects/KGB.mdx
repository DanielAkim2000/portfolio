# Front-End (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

For this KGB mission management project, I developed the user interface without using any front-end frameworks, relying solely on fundamental web technologies:

- **Semantic HTML structure**: Clear content organization with appropriate HTML5 tags for better accessibility
- **Responsive CSS layout**: Creation of an adaptive interface without depending on external libraries like Bootstrap
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Implementation of interactive features without frameworks
- **Dynamic filtering**: Development of a system allowing to filter displayed missions according to different criteria
- **Asynchronous requests**: Use of the Fetch API to communicate with the backend without page reloading
- **Client-side validation**: Verification of form data before sending to the server
- **Administration interface**: Separate dashboards according to users' authorization levels

The most interesting part of the front-end development was creating a dynamic filtering system that allows users to quickly find missions or agents according to different criteria, all without relying on external libraries.

# Back-End (Pure PHP)

For the server part, I developed an application entirely in PHP without using frameworks like Laravel or Symfony. This "from scratch" development allowed me to explore:

- **Manual MVC architecture**: Creation of a Model-View-Controller structure without the help of a framework
- **Custom routing system**: Development of a router to direct requests to the right controllers
- **Secure session management**: Implementation of a robust authentication system
- **Data access**: Creation of database access classes without an ORM
- **Server-side validation**: Verification and cleaning of submitted data
- **Class autoloading**: Manual configuration of class loading following PSR-4 standards
- **Protection against vulnerabilities**: Security against SQL injections, XSS, and CSRF

This work in pure PHP was particularly educational as it allowed me to understand the underlying mechanisms that are usually handled by frameworks, especially security, routing, and MVC structure.

# System Features

This KGB mission management application includes a comprehensive set of features:

## Mission Management

- **Mission creation and editing**: Interface to define new missions with all their parameters
- **Agent assignment**: System for assigning agents to missions according to their specialties
- **Safehouse management**: Association of secure safehouses for each mission
- **Status tracking**: Update of mission status (in preparation, in progress, completed, etc.)
- **Operation history**: Logging of activities related to each mission

## Agent Administration

- **Agent profiles**: Management of personal and professional information
- **Specialties and skills**: Cataloging of expertise and qualifications
- **Availability**: Tracking of assignments and availability for new missions
- **Clearance levels**: Management of access levels to classified information

## Security and Access

- **Differentiated access levels**: Specific rights according to the user's role
- **Connection logging**: Tracking of activities to detect any intrusion
- **Session expiration**: Automatic disconnection after a period of inactivity

This project allowed me to gain a deep understanding of the internal workings of a web application, without the abstraction provided by frameworks. I particularly appreciated the challenge of creating a secure and functional system from scratch, which gave me a better appreciation of the services that modern frameworks offer us.
