# Front-End (Next.js)

I developed the front-end of Bonwazadiler, a clone of the French marketplace "Le Bon Coin", using Next.js. This project allowed me to develop several essential skills for modern web development:

- **Multi-provider authentication**: Integration of different authentication methods (Google, Facebook) in addition to classic email/password authentication
- **Complex forms**: Creation of multi-step listing forms with different types of inputs (text, selection, image upload)
- **Polished UI/UX**: Using Tailwind CSS and ShadCN UI to create a modern and responsive user interface
- **Global state**: Managing application state with React tools
- **Dynamic routing**: Implementation of dynamic routes for navigation between listings and categories

The front-end communicates with a RESTful API to retrieve and send data, manage users and listings. I particularly enjoyed working on the listing layout and the user experience when creating a new listing.

# Back-End (Express.js)

For the back-end of Bonwazadiler, I chose Express.js as I was still learning Next.js and wanted to clearly separate responsibilities. Developing the back-end allowed me to explore:

- **REST API architecture**: Structuring endpoints for different resources (users, listings, categories)
- **Custom middlewares**: Development of middlewares for authentication, data validation, and error handling
- **Security**: Implementation of security measures to protect user data
- **Upload management**: Configuration of storage for listing images
- **OAuth integration**: Configuration of third-party authentication services

I particularly appreciated setting up the authentication system with multiple providers, which allowed me to gain an in-depth understanding of how JWT tokens and sessions work.

# Main Features

This classified ads platform includes several essential features:

## Listing Management

- **Ad Publishing**: Intuitive interface for creating and publishing listings with photos
- **Categorization**: Organization of listings by categories and subcategories
- **Advanced Search**: Multiple filters to refine searches (price, location, etc.)
- **Favorites**: Ability to save listings for later viewing

## User Area

- **Customizable Profile**: Management of personal information and preferences
- **Dashboard**: Tracking of published listings and interactions
- **Integrated Messaging**: Direct communication between buyers and sellers
- **History**: Tracking of past activities and transactions

## Security and Trust

- **Multi-provider Authentication**: Secure login via different methods
- **Moderation**: Reporting and verification system for listings
- **User Ratings**: Rating and review system to build trust
- **Data Protection**: Security measures for personal information

This project taught me a lot about full-stack development and allowed me to put my theoretical knowledge into practice in a real-world context. Managing complex forms on the front-end and securing routes on the back-end were the most interesting challenges to tackle.
