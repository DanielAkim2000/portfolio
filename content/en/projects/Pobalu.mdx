# Design and Mockup

For this website project for a fine arts artist, I worked directly from a mockup provided by the client. This phase allowed me to:

- **Understand specific needs**: Analyze in depth the artistic expectations and desired visual identity
- **Adapt the mockup**: Transform static designs into interactive web elements
- **Plan the site structure**: Organize artwork galleries and biographical content
- **Optimize user experience**: Design a smooth journey to showcase artistic creations

The main challenge was to faithfully respect the unique aesthetic requested by the artist while ensuring good navigability and user experience.

# WordPress Development

Although WordPress is not my main specialty, I took on the challenge of creating a customized and optimized site for this artist. The development allowed me to explore:

- **Customization with Elementor**: In-depth use of Elementor to create complex and artistic layouts
- **Custom JavaScript**: Addition of scripts to create specific interactions, particularly modals when clicking on certain buttons
- **Media optimization**: Configuration of image management plugins to ensure fast loading despite the presence of numerous high-resolution works
- **Site security**: Implementation of measures to protect the site, including securing the login URL
- **Cookie management**: GDPR-compliant configuration and optimization of user experience
