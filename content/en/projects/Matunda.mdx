# Front-End (Expo)

For Matunda, I developed a native mobile application dedicated to consulting and trading stocks, indices, and other financial instruments. Using Expo and React Native, I created a fluid and intuitive user interface exclusively accessible on mobile devices.

This project allowed me to develop several essential skills:

- **Financial API Integration**: Connection with external stock exchange APIs to retrieve real-time data on stock and index prices
- **Data Visualization**: Creation of interactive charts to represent market trends and price history
- **Complex State Management**: Organization of financial data and user preferences
- **Custom Watchlists**: Implementation of a watchlist system allowing users to monitor their favorite stocks
- **News Aggregation**: Integration of financial news feeds to inform users of important events

One of the most interesting parts of the development was creating an interface that makes complex financial data accessible while offering a smooth user experience on different mobile devices.

# Back-End (NestJS)

For the back-end of Matunda, I chose NestJS for its robustness and modular architecture based on solid principles. This choice allowed me to build a reliable and maintainable API for the mobile application.

The backend development allowed me to explore:

- **Modular Architecture**: Organization of code into functional modules (authentication, stocks, watchlists, news)
- **Dependency Injection**: Using NestJS's injection system to create decoupled and testable code
- **Financial Data Management**: Caching and processing stock market data from external APIs
- **Transaction Security**: Implementation of measures to secure buy and sell simulations
- **Authentication Middleware**: Creation of a secure system to protect user data
- **Scheduling**: Automation of financial data updates at regular intervals

One of the major challenges was optimizing performance to handle a large volume of real-time financial data and minimizing latency to provide a responsive user experience.
